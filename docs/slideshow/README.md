# Week 8 Presentation Plan
The presentation will be splitted between the group members. 
Every presenter will have 2 minutes, which is a one page of double spaced text (250 words). 
Please write your speech and save it in a plain text file with the name of the topic so we could see it and give suggestions.
Each of us should prepare  3-5 slides in a separate ppt file with the name of the topic (see below). 
Please create For the slides please use the template in this directory. On weekends I (IgorB) will start compiling the final presentation.
Calculations please do as Excel of Jupyter and save in 'notebooks' directory.

Please don't hesitate to copy text from the proposal document. 
For the 'data-mining' items, let's concentrate on Terminal 1 of SFO which has 12 gates, the summer months (May to Oct).
We need to extract the following information that will be used in LP model:
 - List of airlines;
 - Number of flights per week for each airline;
 - Estimation of passengers per week brought by each airline. 
 Can be calculated by types of planes used by each airline on the terminal, max number of passengers in each;
 - Airlines predicted performance for next season. What I need here is a coefficient of 
 between 0..1 that reflects predicted airline reliability in relation to what was promiced (use delays, cancellations etc).
