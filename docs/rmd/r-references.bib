In this paper, we study the Airport Gate Assignment Problem (AGAP), propose a new model and implement the model with Optimization Programming language (OPL). With the objective to minimize the number of conflicts of any two adjacent aircrafts assigned to the same gate, we build a mathematical model with logical constraints and the binary constraints, which can provide an efficient evaluation criterion for the Airlines to estimate the current gate assignment. To illustrate the feasibility of the model we construct experiments with the data obtained from Continental Airlines, Houston Gorge Bush Intercontinental Air-port IAH, which indicate that our model is both energetic and effective. Moreover, we interpret experimental results, which further demonstrate that our proposed model can provide a powerful tool for airline companies to estimate the efficiency of their current work of gate assignment.},

Capacity constraints and resulting congestion and low schedule reliability currently impose large costs on airlines and their passengers. Signiﬁcant capacity increases that would solve these problems are not expected in the near- or medium-term. This paper outlines ﬁrst a number of directions for effecting improvement through marginal capacity increases and better management of demand and available capacity. It then describes strategic initiatives that airlines and civil aviation authorities might undertake over time horizons of months to years as well as tactical measures that may be adopted on a daily basis in response to dynamic, ‘‘real-time’’ developments like poor weather or schedule disruptions. Research challenges in these areas are identiﬁed and classiﬁed in terms of specifying, allocating, and utilizing capacity. The ﬁrst two categories reﬂect challenges faced by infrastructure providers, the last category challenges faced by airlines.},

	abstract = {In order to solve discrete optimization problem, the SKF algorithm is combined with angle modulated approach. Airport gate allocation problem refers to the search for optimal assignment of flights to gates at an airport. Assignment of flight to gates has become very complex nowadays, especially for a big size airport. In this study, the airport gate allocation problem is solved using a recently introduced angle modulated simulated Kalman filter (AMSKF). The objective of this study is to minimize the total walking distance. A small case study with 14 flights and 16 gates has been chosen. Preliminary results show that SKF is a promising algorithm for solving the airport gate allocation problem.},

The methodology uses aggregate measures of properties of aircraft assignments, called Aircraft Assignment Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and aims to find correlations between them and the operational performance of the airline. A simulation experiment is prepared to gather a large set of data points for analysis. A motivation is given for the use of control theoretic approaches in airline operations to utilize the KPIs as a basis for initial planning and corrective actions.},

The larger the number of passengers arriving on flight X for destination A, the closer flight X should be positioned to the flight departing for A.

The criterion selected is minimization of the total passenger-distance travel for a given arrival-departure cycle. The problem can be conveniently cast as a 0,1 Linear Programming (LP) problem.},
