	abstract = {John F. Kennedy International Airport (IATA: JFK, ICAO: KJFK, FAA LID: JFK) (often referred to as Kennedy Airport, New York-JFK or simply JFK) is the primary international airport serving New York City. It is the busiest international air passenger gateway into North America, the 22nd busiest airport in the world, the 6th busiest airport in the United States, and the busiest airport in the New York airport system. JFK handled just over 59 million passengers in 2017. Over ninety airlines operate out of the airport, with non-stop or direct flights to destinations in all six inhabited continents.
JFK is located in the neighborhood of Jamaica in the borough of Queens, in New York, 16 miles (30 km) southeast of Midtown Manhattan. The airport features six passenger terminals and four runways. It serves as a hub for American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. It is also the primary operating base for JetBlue Airways. In the past, JFK was a hub for Pan Am, TWA, Eastern, National, and Tower Air.
Opened as New York International Airport in 1948, it was commonly known as Idlewild Airport before being renamed in 1963 in memory of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, following his assassination.},

	abstract = {San Francisco International Airport (IATA: SFO, ICAO: KSFO, FAA LID: SFO) is an international airport 13 miles (21 km) south of downtown San Francisco, California, United States, near Millbrae and San Bruno in unincorporated San Mateo County. It has flights to points throughout North America and is a major gateway to Europe and Asia.
SFO is the largest airport in Northern California and the second-busiest in California, after Los Angeles International Airport. In 2017, it was the 7th busiest in the United States and the 24th busiest airport in the world by passenger count. It is the fifth-largest hub for United Airlines and functions as United Airlines' primary transpacific gateway. It also serves as a secondary hub for Alaska Airlines. It is the sole maintenance hub of United Airlines, and houses the Louis A. Turpen Aviation Museum and Library.
SFO is owned and policed by the City and County of San Francisco, but is in San Mateo County. Between 1999 and 2004 the San Francisco Airport Commission operated city-owned SFO Enterprises, Inc., to oversee its business purchases and operations of ventures.},

In this paper, we study the Airport Gate Assignment Problem (AGAP), propose a new model and implement the model with Optimization Programming language (OPL). With the objective to minimize the number of conflicts of any two adjacent aircrafts assigned to the same gate, we build a mathematical model with logical constraints and the binary constraints, which can provide an efficient evaluation criterion for the Airlines to estimate the current gate assignment. To illustrate the feasibility of the model we construct experiments with the data obtained from Continental Airlines, Houston Gorge Bush Intercontinental Air-port IAH, which indicate that our model is both energetic and effective. Moreover, we interpret experimental results, which further demonstrate that our proposed model can provide a powerful tool for airline companies to estimate the efficiency of their current work of gate assignment.},

Capacity constraints and resulting congestion and low schedule reliability currently impose large costs on airlines and their passengers. Signiﬁcant capacity increases that would solve these problems are not expected in the near- or medium-term. This paper outlines ﬁrst a number of directions for effecting improvement through marginal capacity increases and better management of demand and available capacity. It then describes strategic initiatives that airlines and civil aviation authorities might undertake over time horizons of months to years as well as tactical measures that may be adopted on a daily basis in response to dynamic, ‘‘real-time’’ developments like poor weather or schedule disruptions. Research challenges in these areas are identiﬁed and classiﬁed in terms of specifying, allocating, and utilizing capacity. The ﬁrst two categories reﬂect challenges faced by infrastructure providers, the last category challenges faced by airlines.},

Airport gate allocation problem refers to the search for optimal assignment of flights to gates at an airport. Assignment of flight to gates has become very complex nowadays, especially for a big size airport. In this study, the airport gate allocation problem is solved using a recently introduced angle modulated simulated Kalman filter (AMSKF). The objective of this study is to minimize the total walking distance. A small case study with 14 flights and 16 gates has been chosen. Preliminary results show that SKF is a promising algorithm for solving the airport gate allocation problem.},

The methodology uses aggregate measures of properties of aircraft assignments, called Aircraft Assignment Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and aims to find correlations between them and the operational performance of the airline. A simulation experiment is prepared to gather a large set of data points for analysis. A motivation is given for the use of control theoretic approaches in airline operations to utilize the KPIs as a basis for initial planning and corrective actions.},
