## Environmental/Socio-Economic Aspects:
Airplanes are noisy. If you live near an airport you may be subconsciously use to the sound that they eliminate; however even at sound levels not harmful to hearing, the intensity, frequency, vibrations, complexity of the sound and its duration, our bodies subconsciously perceive noise as a danger signal.
“Unwanted sound is perceived as a noise stressor and our bodies respond to these stressors by triggering fight or flight response, a rise in blood pressure, heart rate accelerates, stress hormones surge. All of these are conditions can be precursors to cardiovascular disease.” [1]

GOAL: Rerouting flights to gates away from residential areas at specific times of day would reduce noise pollution and improve the quality of life in surrounding local communities.
